# template repo for calling lwmbs workflow

## 怎么用

**不要fork这个repo!** （可能会遇到奇怪的权限问题）

clone这个repo，推送到你自己的仓库（其实直接把那个workflow搞过去就行了）

它每天都会生成三个release，里面有各种二进制，你也可以通过workflow里面的with参数选择要定制构建啥东西

## How to use

**DONOT fork this repo!** (you may get some strange error)

Clone it, then push to your own repository (actually you can just copy the workflow file)

It will generate three releases every day, with various binaries. you can also customize what to build by changing the `with` parameter in workflow file
